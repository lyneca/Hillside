These worlds are various copies of a MineCraft game I'm playing. (singleplayer)

Details are as follows:


AMPLIFIED world generator. (So beautiful ;.;)
seed is either:
	lalala
or
	-1110123361

(The first converts into the second, tested.)

The world is a typical AMPLIFIED world, nothing special, but I'm commiting to it like I never have, and I'll actually be... building things!
I've been playing MC for a long long time, but I was always too young to really play it properly, so this is a nostalgic attempt to make up for all of the wasted years.

I'm playing locked on hard mode, and the world has cheats but I only use them in duplicated versions of the world (which don't get uploaded.)

I am not playing very hardcore, just because that is a lot of work and MC is already enough of an RNG grind, so I'll do what I want.
I am always playing with F3 debug info available, and I am using that to navigate. I'm taking screenshots of death locations and landmarks so that I can find them, all of that gray-area exploit jazz.

I'm still not using cheats though, I can trust myself not to :)
